# unit-testing
This is a mockup project that contains some JavaScript code that needs to be tested. The tests are written with Jest, and can be run with the Maven exec plugin.

Getting started
To get started, make sure that you have Node.js and Maven installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-project.git
````

Install the Node.js dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Run the Jest tests with Maven:

```
mvn test
```

This will run the Jest tests using the Maven exec plugin. If the tests pass, you should see a message that says "All tests passed!". If there are any test failures, you will see the error messages in the console.
